&lt;p&gt;I had no idea this was how the passcode feature worked. Enabling now in all devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While it is wonderful that many Americans become foster parents to adopt or “save” children, we need wrap-around supports in local communities, and we need families now more than ever before who are willing to foster children for a period of time while parents overcome addiction. To stop negative societal trends that are ravaged by drug addiction, we need an “all hands on deck” approach to help vulnerable children in our own backyards.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with Senator Lankford that &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; families impacted by foster care need support and I believe reunification is important. We have fostered multiple children who were reunified, and it was a beautiful thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think foster children should have a right to permanency. At what point does sticking with a goal of reunification begin to hurt a child’s wellbeing? If a 2.5 year old has been with foster parents over 2 years, how much more harmful would reunification be to the child than staying with the only family they know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foster care system is broken in so many ways, and it’s always the kids who are the victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Obviously, the studio has to be looking at Solo and trying to figure out what more it could have done to better promote the film, but if you think that this hiccup is the beginning of Star Wars’ demise… well, you must be new here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thoughts on New iPad Hardware at WWDC</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Apple blogs and podcasts are all predicting new iPad Pros released next week at WWDC. While I would love for this to happen and will be first in line to get an iPhone X style iPad, I don’t think we’re going to get them for 2 reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there’s the lack of leaks. While this is not a perfect indicator due to Apple’s increased focus on privacy, I still find it hard to believe they’ve come so far since the massive leaks surrounding iPhone X last fall. I feel like we would have seen supply chain leaks of form factors for new iPads with no bezels if they are coming. This suggests either the new iPad Pros will just be a speed bump to include the A11X processor with no form factor change or new form factors won’t be released until the fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other factor which makes me think not until the fall is Face ID. Currently on iPhone X, Face ID only works in portrait mode. For an iPad which is rotated far more than an iPhone, facial recognition in both orientations is a necessity. This seems to me like a feature that would come to iOS in a major .0 update rather than say iOS 11.5. I also don’t think they would release iPads with this feature and not add it to iPhone X. So my thought is multi-orientation Face ID will be announced as part of iOS 12 next week. Then in September when new iPhones are announced, new iPad Pros will also be announced that take advantage of this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a guess, and I really hope to be proven wrong. However I wanted to put it out into the world just for the bragging rights just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started teaching, all I wanted was to teach 2nd Grade at this school. It was a huge moment the first time I stepped into this room and it was &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; 2nd Grade room. 3 years later I’m moving out and up to 3rd grade. New adventures will be fun, but this room will be missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m all for productivity apps or apps with server components having a subscription. A utility I would use every 6 months or so for 10 minutes doesn’t warrant $12 a year though. If Gemini was a five dollar single purchase (even potentially 10 because the design is so nice), I would pick it up immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a developer, nor do I want to be. I appreciate the difficulties they face though and hope they can find the right balance of pricing and value to be successful. I also hope Gemini is valuable enough to others for it to be a worthwhile endeavor for Mac Paw. When great apps succeed, it’s better for everyone. It’s just not going to be the tool for me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I gave up using Day One a year ago because I felt like my journaling had more depth with pen and paper… but I didn’t ever journal. So I’ve brought Day One back. Regular, but more shallow journaling is better than not at all, right?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;While today’s episode of Revisionist History was interesting in and of itself, &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+NG9L1B8JM/15:34&quot;&gt;the Uber ad&lt;/a&gt; about making the company better for everyone was the most interesting part. Bozoma St. John at work?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;After hearing people on &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/monday&quot;&gt;@monday&lt;/a&gt; talking about their first blogs, I looked and my Livejournal from high school and first year of college (when Apple released iWeb!) is still online. How I had any friends at that point in my life is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, as a teacher I get excited about being out of school, but the best part of summer is The Peach Truck.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m currently in a movie theater recliner about to watch Infinity War by myself while my wife takes care of our children. I’m thankful for relaxation during the chaotic end of the school year and for a wife who is ok with me needing that.&lt;/p&gt;
