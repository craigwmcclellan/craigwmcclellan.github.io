On Tuesday, my sweet grandfather, Gordon Craig, passed away. He was a month shy of his 90th birthday, and was one of the kindest, funniest men I've ever met. I'm lucky to have been his grandson, and that I can carry his name in mine.

I'm proud to say I also received the teaching gene from him and my grandmother. Both taught in their small town school, and Grandpa was also a basketball coach and principal. He retired right around when I was born though, so I never got to experience what he was like in that role.

Last night we had his visitation, and I was amazed as literally hundreds of former students came to honor my Grandpa. There were legitimate class reunions happening in the chapel. Each of them spoke to me and shared the impact my grandparents both had on their lives. One man even said to me "Mr. Craig was a legend around here."

I'm so thankful for the life my Grandpa lived, the lives he touched, the legacy he leaves, and most of all that he is with Jesus today and no longer suffering. I pray that I can be a fraction of the man, teacher, and legend he was.
