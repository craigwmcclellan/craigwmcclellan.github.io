Last year, iOS 11 Dev Beta 2 was released 2 weeks after Beta 1, and the Public Beta was a day or two after. If that holds true this year, we should see an iOS 12 Public Beta next week. In years past, I've put one iPad on the beta leaving my phone and one iPad on the current version. With MeMoji though, I have a feeling it will be phone and 10.5" iPad on iOS 12, and the 12.9" staying on 11.
