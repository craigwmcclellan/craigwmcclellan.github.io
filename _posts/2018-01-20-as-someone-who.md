As someone who is decidedly not a programmer, I have spent the better part of 3 days writing a JavaScript Action for Drafts 5 to get info from Airtable using their API, give me prompts about that data, and then send my draft to Airtable based on the selections I’ve made. The amount of time I’ve spent on this will never be returned by the time it saves me, and I still have a few more hours to put into it...but it’s been so dang fun.
