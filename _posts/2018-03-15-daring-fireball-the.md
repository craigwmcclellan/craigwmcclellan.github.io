[Daring Fireball: The Information on What Went Wrong With Siri](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/03/14/the-information-siri)

> The gist of The Information’s story is that Siri has existed for seven years without cohesive leadership or product vision, and the underlying technology is a mishmash of various systems that don’t work well together.

No one commenting on Siri's quality is discussing that Siri was moved under Craig Federighi's supervision just 6 months ago. I'm hoping this leads to much more cohesive leadership and product vision, and will be what is laid out for us at WWDC this year.
