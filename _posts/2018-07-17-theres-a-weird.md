There's a weird tension in foster parenting of how much to share. On one hand, our story is not actually ours to share, but our children's. On the other hand we want to encourage others who are in the middle of or considering the same journey.

So while I will always err on the side of protecting my girls, I hope to find more ways to share something that is a huge part of my life here on this blog.
