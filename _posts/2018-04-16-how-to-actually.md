[How to actually get work done on an iPad](https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/12/ipad-laptop-replacement/) -- Engadget

> Let's be honest: The iPad can't do everything (as much as Apple might want you to think so). For some tasks, you'll have to suck it up and use a real computer for maximum efficiency. But that doesn't mean your iPad becomes useless. In fact, with a simple app and a Lightning cable, you can turn your iPad into a second monitor for your laptop or desktop.

I hate this paragraph so much.
