[Everyone Has A Story - Brené Brown](https://brenebrown.com/blog/2018/06/07/everyone-has-a-story/)

> To know pain is human. To need is human. And, no amount of money, influence, resources, or sheer determination will change our physical, emotional, and spiritual dependence on others.

> Many of us are willing to extend a helping hand, but we’re very reluctant to reach out for help when we need it ourselves. It’s as if we’ve divided the world into “those who offer help” and “those who need help.” The truth is that we are both.  Need is the most beautiful compact between humans.
