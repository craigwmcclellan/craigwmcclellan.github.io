I'm really pleased with how [this Drafts 5 script](https://github.com/craigwmcclellan/Public-Drafts-Scripts/tree/master/Blog%20Post%20Idea%20Workflow) for logging blog post ideas in Things and Ulysses turned out. It creates a sheet in Ulysses, then places the link to that sheet in the notes of a Things task.
