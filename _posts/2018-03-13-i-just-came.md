I just came home to find my wife listening to music through our Bose Soundlink Mini set right next to our HomePod. 

Even though the HomePod has Apple Music and we have a family account, it can't access her personalized playlists. She also hates Airplay because of the delay. So for now, she refuses to use the HomePod.

While I love the HomePod for me, in fact, I would love several [mini HomePods](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/03/07/lower-priced-homepod-150-to-200-dollars-rumor/) around the house, the main issue I have is the multi-person support. 

My wife and I have a shared grocery list in Reminders that she can't access when I'm not home. Our Echo Dot can via IFTTT.

I'm all in on HomePod. I just wish my family could be too.
